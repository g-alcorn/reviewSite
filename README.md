This YouTube video shows the basic functionality of the site.

Upon loading, the homepage shows a selection of restaurants. The user can open the reviews for each restaurant, or open the link to Google Maps.
If a user would like to make a review, they need to login using a username and ID number. Then, they can create, update, and delete their own reviews.
The reviews, as well as the username and ID number, are stored in real-time on the MongoDB Atlas cloud platform.
